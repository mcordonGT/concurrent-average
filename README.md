# concurrent-average
Challenge to compute the average of a random sequence

## Challenge
Write a program that uses the sequencer to generate a sequence of numbers and compute the average of the sequence.
The sequencer generates a random number between 0 and 100 with a random latency.

The program should:
- Generate as much numbers as possible in 10 seconds
- Compare the average with the average computed by the sequencer
- Print the average
